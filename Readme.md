# üõ†Ô∏è Practice Project: Product & Category API

> This project was developed to review essential backend concepts with Spring Boot, including:
> - Bidirectional relationships in JPA
> - Using DTOs to decouple the domain layer from the API
> - Validations with Bean Validation
> - Global error handling with `@ControllerAdvice`
